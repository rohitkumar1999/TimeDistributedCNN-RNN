# CNN-RNN architecture using Time Distributed Layers 

The model architecture is targeted to achieve a nominal accuracy for video analysis. It was a part of a sign language detection project made for TicTechToe-18 @DAIICT.

## Getting Started

All you need to get started is a system with a python-interpreter installed.

### Prerequisites

Tensorflow - 

```
pip install tensorflow
```
Tensorlayer -
 ```
 pip install tensorlayer
 ```
 Scikit-learn -
 ```
 pip install sklearn
 ```
### Running the model
The file 'model' contains checkpoints for the NN that was trained with our datasets. If you wish u could reuse the same weights or can specify your own file path.
